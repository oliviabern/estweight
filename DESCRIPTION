Description: Convenience samples are often used to estimate associations but this may lead to unrepresenative estimates. This packages contains functions to estimate sampling weights for a convenience sample using information from a representative sample. The sampling weights are used to weight a GLM for the scientific question of inference to obtain more representative inference. The sampling weights are also used to estimate propensity scores and propensity score weighted treatment effects.
